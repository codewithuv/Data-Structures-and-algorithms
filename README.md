# 🚀 Data Structures and Algorithms  

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
Here, I solve and upload problems from **LeetCode** and other platforms to strengthen my problem-solving skills.  

---

## 📌 Repository Structure  
- Each folder is named as:  
  **`L.<LeetCode Question Number> <Problem Title>`**  
  Example: `L.3446 Sort Matrix by Diagonals` → refers to **LeetCode Question 3446**.  

- Inside each folder, you’ll find my **Java/Python solutions** with a clear and optimized approach.
